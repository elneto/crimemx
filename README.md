SENSP visualization with D3, Kartograph, Highcharts and NVD3.

Takes SENSP rates of crime tables and maps them to a pseudo-demers map, a choropleth map, a bar chart and individual line charts per state.

The pseudo-Demers cartogram is based on: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4055889

It ranks the crime rates per year and show them in a bar graph with each color corresponding to both the pseudo-demers and the geographic map.

More on the file generation is available in the wiki.
